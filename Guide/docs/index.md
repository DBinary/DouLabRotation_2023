This repository was used to contain the tutorials of telemere length calculation for single cell DNA-seq data. This is the work I completed during the first rotation at the School of Life Sciences, WestLake University and supervised by Professor [Yanmei Dou](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yanmei-dou.html).
