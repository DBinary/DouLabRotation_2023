# DouLabRotation_2023
The repository was used to contain tutorials of telemere length calculation for single cell DNA-seq data. It represents the work I completed during the first rotation at the [School of Life Sciences](https://sls.westlake.edu.cn/), [WestLake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and supervised by Professor [Yanmei Dou](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yanmei-dou.html).
